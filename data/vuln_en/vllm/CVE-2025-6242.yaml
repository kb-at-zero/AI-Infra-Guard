  cve: CVE-2025-6242
  summary: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in vLLM's MediaConnector class
  details: |
    A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector` class of vLLM, specifically within the `load_from_url` and `load_from_url_async` methods. These functions fetch media content from user-provided URLs without validating the destination host. This allows attackers to force the server to make requests to internal services or localhost, potentially leading to internal network reconnaissance, denial of service, or interaction with unprotected internal APIs.
    The issue is especially dangerous in containerized environments like `llm-d`, where an exploited SSRF could be used to disrupt other pods or extract sensitive information from internal endpoints. Although the `file://` scheme is partially restricted by `--allowed-local-media-path`, HTTP/HTTPS-based SSRF remains a critical threat.
    The vulnerability affects versions from 0.5.0 up to (but not including) 0.11.0.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade vLLM to version 0.11.0 or later.
    2. Implement domain/IP allowlists or denylists to restrict outbound media fetching.
    3. Add hostname and IP validation in `MediaConnector` before initiating any network request.
    4. Review internal service exposure and ensure internal endpoints are properly authenticated and isolated.
rule: version >= "0.5.0" && version < "0.11.0"

  cve: CVE-2025-59425
  summary: Timing attack vulnerability in vLLM API key validation
  details: |
    The API key validation mechanism in vLLM was susceptible to timing attacks due to the use of a non-constant-time string comparison.
    This allowed attackers to potentially deduce a valid API key through repeated requests and response time analysis.
    Specifically, the vulnerability existed in the authentication logic at line 1270-1274 of `api_server.py`, where each correct character in a guessed API key would result in measurably longer processing times.
    Deployments using vLLM's built-in API key protection were at risk of authentication bypass.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to vLLM version 0.11.0 or later which includes a fix using constant-time comparison.
    2. Review and replace any custom API key validation logic with secure, constant-time comparison functions.
    3. Monitor access logs for unusual patterns that may indicate timing attack attempts.
rule: version >= "0" && version < "0.11.0"

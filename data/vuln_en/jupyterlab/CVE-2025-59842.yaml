  summary: JupyterLab LaTeX typesetter links did not enforce `noopener` attribute
  details: |
    Links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and cells lacked the `noopener` attribute. While this theoretically exposes users of third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions to reverse tabnabbing attacks, no known extensions are affected at this time. The issue has no impact on default installations.
    For improved security and consistency, newer versions of JupyterLab now enforce both `noopener` and `target=_blank` attributes on all links produced by LaTeX typesetters.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
  severity: LOW
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to JupyterLab version 4.4.8 or later.
    2. Review any custom or third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions for secure link generation practices.
rule: version >= "0.0.0" && version < "4.4.8"
